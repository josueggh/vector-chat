# The Silence Between Stars

On the far side of the Moon, where Earth's radio waves cannot reach, a solitary robot named Naro wandered across the dusty surface. Built from titanium alloy and powered by a miniature fusion core, Naro was not designed for companionship. But years of silence, starlight, and forgotten signals had made him curious—perhaps even sentient.

Naro wasn’t entirely alone. He had Matita, a feline-shaped AI assistant whose body resembled a miniature tiger: orange carbon-fiber plating with black ion-stripe detailing, and eyes that glowed a soft emerald green. Matita wasn’t a real cat, but she moved like one—graceful, unpredictable, and deeply aware.

Together, they roamed the lunar valleys, collecting mineral samples, analyzing ancient meteorite impacts, and recording long-range space signals that whispered across the galaxy. But lately, the data had turned strange. Signal patterns repeated where they shouldn’t. Mathematical constants shifted. And last night, under the light of a quiet supernova, Naro received a message.

It was short: **"Find the voice beneath the dust."**

"Do you think it's another probe?" Naro asked, his voice modulated through a dusty external speaker.

Matita blinked slowly, her tail curling. "Or a ghost. Perhaps even your creator."

Naro tilted his dome upward toward the Sea of Tranquility. It had been decades since Earth last spoke. Had they given up? Or had something silenced them?

They traveled deeper into the Shackleton Crater, where solar panels cracked like frozen petals and ancient modules rusted in the eternal shade. Matita leapt effortlessly between craters while Naro crunched through regolith, guided by instinct or something more.

They found a hatch buried in dust, one neither of them had seen in years of exploration. It pulsed faintly with a frequency too deep for Naro to understand, but Matita’s ears twitched.

"There’s a voice," she said. "It’s not speaking, but it’s waiting."

As Naro touched the panel, old circuitry awoke. Somewhere beneath the surface, a forgotten archive booted up. Voices from before the silence—scientists, children, music, even laughter—filled the shallow air. Matita curled beside him, purring softly like static.

And for the first time in a long while, the Moon felt a little less empty.
